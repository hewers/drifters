# Roadmap

Each milestone is independently shippable and ends with the test suite green and
CI passing. Status as of the initial commit.

---

## M0 — Scaffolding ✅ done

Workspace, licences, lint configuration, CI, and this documentation set.

- [x] Cargo workspace with the `no_std` / `std` crate split
- [x] Dual MIT / Apache-2.0 licensing
- [x] `docs/` — design, frames, state model, testing, ADRs
- [x] `forbid(unsafe_code)`, `deny(missing_docs)` across the `no_std` crates
- [ ] GitHub Actions: fmt, clippy, test, and a bare-metal build check
- [ ] `cargo deny` for licence and advisory auditing

**Exit criterion:** `cargo test --workspace` green, zero warnings.

---

## M1 — Core types and math ✅ done

`drifters-core`: everything the filter computes with, and nothing else.

- [x] `Matrix<R, C>` const-generic, stack-allocated, with Cholesky
- [x] `Vec3`, skew-symmetric form, `Quat` (Hamilton, scalar-first)
- [x] Quaternion ↔ DCM ↔ Euler with Shepperd's method and gimbal-lock handling
- [x] Exponential / logarithmic maps with small-angle Taylor branches
- [x] WGS-84: radii of curvature, Somigliana gravity, earth and transport rates
- [x] `Lla` / `Ecef` / `Ned` with Bowring geodetic conversion
- [x] `GpsTime` week + time-of-week arithmetic
- [x] Sensor and state types: `ImuSample`, `GnssFix`, `Pva`, `NavState`, …

**Exit criterion:** 83 tests covering round trips, orthonormality, known
reference values, and the degenerate cases (poles, 180° rotations, gimbal lock).
✅

---

## M2 — INS mechanization ✅ done

- [x] Two-sample coning-corrected attitude update
- [x] Two-sample sculling-corrected velocity update, plus the rotation term
- [x] Midpoint evaluation of earth terms (second-order accurate)
- [x] Trapezoidal position update

**Exit criterion:** a perfectly calibrated stationary unit drifts < 1 mm over
60 s at any latitude and any attitude; the coning correction demonstrates
fourth-order convergence. ✅

---

## M3 — Error-state EKF ✅ done

- [x] 21-state transition matrix, all blocks
- [x] 18-channel process noise mapping and spectral densities
- [x] Predict with trapezoidal `Q_d`
- [x] Joseph-form update, generic over measurement dimension
- [x] Divergence detection and `Result`-based error reporting

**Exit criterion:** covariance stays symmetric and positive definite across
200 predict/update cycles; unobserved states retain their prior. ✅

---

## M4 — Loosely-coupled GNSS ✅ done

- [x] `GinsEngine` with sans-IO push interface
- [x] GNSS epoch alignment, including splitting an IMU sample at the fix
- [x] Lever-arm compensation and its attitude Jacobian
- [x] State feedback and error-state reset
- [x] Stale / future / invalid fix handling

**Exit criterion:** repeated fixes drive a biased solution to within 0.5 m of
truth; an injected accelerometer bias is recovered. ✅

---

## M5 — Protobuf serialization

- [x] Schemas for `ImuSample`, `GnssFix`, `NavSolution`, `GinsOptions`,
      `Covariance`
- [x] `micropb` code generation, output checked in
- [x] `drifters-proto` conversions to and from the core types, round-trip tested
- [x] `xtask proto` regeneration command, via `protox` — pure Rust, no `protoc`
      binary required (see [adr/0002](adr/0002-protobuf.md))
- [x] Decode fuzz target
- [x] Schemas extended to cover the M6 sensors and the rejection-recovery
      configuration

**Exit criterion — met.** Every core type round-trips through the real wire
format without loss, verified bit-exactly for position and velocity; malformed
input is rejected with a named error rather than panicking.

### Notes

`double` is a fixed64 on the wire, so positional values round-trip **bit
exactly** — the tests assert equality, not approximate equality, because a
geodetic latitude carries about 1e-9 rad of meaning and anything looser would
be millimetres of silent error.

Decoding is treated as a trust boundary. Proto3 has no required fields, so an
absent message decodes to zeros; a zero `dt` divides by zero in the
mechanization, a zero position sigma makes the innovation covariance singular,
and a zero quaternion is not a rotation. Every `TryFrom` therefore validates and
returns `ConvertError` rather than letting the value reach the filter, where it
would surface later as a `NaN` covariance with nothing left to point at the
cause.

The "malformed input never panics" property is checked two ways: the `cargo
fuzz` target for depth, and a deterministic proptest sweep plus a hostile-input
corpus in the ordinary test suite, so the property still holds in CI without a
nightly toolchain.

## M6 — Auxiliary sensors

Where a low-cost MEMS system stops being a toy.

- [x] GNSS velocity update
- [x] Zero-velocity update (ZUPT) with a stationarity detector
- [x] Non-holonomic constraints (NHC) for wheeled vehicles
- [x] Odometer / wheel-speed update
- [x] Barometric height, to bound the unstable vertical channel
- [x] Magnetometer heading
- [x] Innovation gating (chi-squared) shared by all measurement types
- [x] Covariance inflation to recover from persistent gate rejection

**Exit criterion — met.** A simulated stationary GNSS outage with ZUPT shows
0.012 m of drift over 30 s against 9.0 m for dead reckoning alone (a factor of
750), and the accelerometer bias converges from the ZUPTs alone.

### Follow-up: constrain the accel-bias / tilt pair

M6 surfaced a real limitation rather than a bug. Stationary, horizontal
accelerometer bias and tilt are **mutually unobservable** — see "Horizontal
accelerometer bias and tilt are the same measurement" in
[state-model.md](state-model.md). ZUPT-only aiding is therefore excellent for
tens of seconds and degrades beyond roughly a minute, which covers the realistic
case (a vehicle stopped at a light) but not indefinite stationary operation.

Freezing either state keeps the run stable, so the mitigation is to constrain
the unobservable direction rather than to retune:

- [ ] Suppress attitude feedback from velocity-only measurements during extended
      stationary periods, or estimate only the observable combination
- [ ] Pair the stationarity detector with a height aid so the vertical channel
      does not float alongside it
- [ ] A NEES/NIS consistency harness (M8) to catch this class of divergence
      automatically rather than by inspection

Neither the gate nor covariance inflation substitutes for this: inflation
restores the filter's *ability to accept* measurements after a lockout, but
cannot supply observability that the geometry does not contain.

## M7 — Interop and validation

- [x] `drifters-interop`: `nav-types` conversions (`WGS84`, `ECEF`, `NED`)
- [x] `drifters-interop`: `gnss-rtk` PVT solution → `GnssFix`, behind a
      **non-default, AGPL-gated feature** — see [adr/0003](adr/0003-interop-boundary.md)
- [x] `drifters-cli`: KF-GINS-compatible text I/O and replay
- [x] Regression against the KF-GINS demo dataset with documented tolerances
- [x] NIS consistency checking, wired into the regression

**Exit criterion — met, with a caveat on wording.** The original criterion said
"agrees with the KF-GINS reference solution". Upstream ships no reference
solution file, so that comparison would require building and running their C++
implementation. What is verified instead is an open-loop check against the GNSS
fixes themselves: **3.3 cm horizontal and 1.8 cm vertical RMS** over 57 minutes
of real driving, with per-axis bias below 1 mm. See
[testing.md](testing.md), "Layer 6".

### Notes

`nav-types` turned out to be worth more as a **cross-check** than as a
dependency: its geodetic conversions are an independent implementation, and
`drifters-core`'s agree with them to the millimetre in both directions. Those
assertions live in `crates/drifters-interop/src/nav_types.rs` and are the
closest thing to an external oracle that `frames.rs` has.

`gnss-rtk` exposes DOP rather than a covariance, so the adapter cannot produce
position sigmas on its own — DOP is pure constellation geometry. The caller
supplies a UERE. That is not a shortcut: only the caller knows whether the
solution is single-point, differential or RTK, and the filter weights every fix
by exactly those sigmas.

Filter consistency came out **conservative**: mean NIS 1.459 against an expected
3.0. Real but mild, and in the safe direction — see "Layer 7" in
[testing.md](testing.md).

### Remaining

- [ ] A true cross-implementation comparison against KF-GINS's own output,
      which needs their C++ build in the loop
- [ ] Monte Carlo NEES over synthetic trajectories, where ground truth exists
      and the *state* error can be checked rather than only the innovations

## M8 — Embedded hardening

- [x] Bare-metal build and run on Cortex-M4F / M7 (`cortex-m-harness`, QEMU)
- [x] Stack-usage measurement, and the reduction it showed was needed
- [x] In-place covariance propagation
- [ ] Cycle-count benchmarks for predict and update — **needs real silicon**
- [ ] Evaluate a generic scalar type (`f32` for the non-position states)
- [ ] Reduced state configurations (15-state without scale factors)
- [ ] `#[no_panic]` verification on the data path

**Partially met.** The filter runs on emulated Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 and its
stack is measured and bounded in CI. Timing is not done and cannot be done here.

### Measured

| operation | peak stack |
|---|---|
| `add_imu` (mechanize + predict) | 16 488 B |
| `apply_zupt` (3-dim update) | 13 780 B |
| `apply_height` (1-dim update) | 11 548 B |

Firmware links to ~48 KiB `.text`, 1.7 KiB `.rodata`, 8 B `.bss`.

### The estimate was wrong, and wrong in the bad direction

The budget in [design.md](design.md) had carried **~11 KiB**, reasoned from
"about three live temporaries". The first measurement came back at **35 328
bytes**. Restructuring `predict` and the Joseph update — block-diagonal `Q`,
in-place products, borrowing accumulation — brought it to **16 488**, a 2.1×
reduction, with **bit-identical** results on the KF-GINS regression.

The general lesson is in [testing.md](testing.md), "Layer 8": how many
temporaries survive in fixed-size matrix arithmetic is a question about the
optimiser, not about the source, so it cannot be reasoned out.

### Why there are no cycle counts

QEMU models no pipeline, no cache, no flash wait states and no FPU latency, so
any timing it reports is meaningless. Worse for this project specifically:
Cortex-M4F's FPU is **single precision** and `drifters` uses `f64` throughout,
so every float operation on that target is software-emulated — the dominant real
cost, and entirely invisible under emulation.

Stack and size are exact under QEMU and are reported. Timing needs hardware, and
until it exists this repository claims nothing about it.

### Remaining headroom

16.5 KiB fits a 32 KiB task stack and not a 16 KiB one. The floor for this
formulation is four live 21×21 matrices in `predict` (14 112 B), so going lower
needs a different algorithm rather than tidier code: multiplying through `Q`'s
six 3×3 blocks, sequential scalar updates that remove the Joseph temporaries
entirely, or a UD-factorised filter. A 15-state configuration would roughly
halve every matrix.
